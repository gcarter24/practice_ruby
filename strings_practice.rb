# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).
# x = "tim"
# y = "allen"
#
# p x + " " + y
# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).
# x = "tim"
# y = "allen"
# p "#{x}" + " " + "#{y}"
# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".
# p "enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# end
# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).
# x = "blue"
# y = "red"
# z = "white"
# p "The American flag is " + y + ", " + z + " and " + x

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."
# p "Enter a name"
# name = gets.chomp
# if name != "Santa"
#   p "You're not Santa!"
# end
# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).
# x = "GOT"
# y = "George RR Martin"
# p x + " was a book that was made into a show for HBO written by " + y

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"
# p "Enter a password"
# password = gets.chomp
