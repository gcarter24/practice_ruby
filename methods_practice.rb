# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.
# p "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp.upcase
# p word

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.
# p "enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# if number > 100
#   p "That's a big number!"
# end
# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.
# p "Enter two numbers"
# num1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# p num1 + num2
# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.
# p "enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.reverse
# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.
# p "enter a number"
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# p num * 10

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
# p "enter two words"
# word1 = gets.chomp.upcase
# word2 = gets.chomp.upcase
# p word1 + " " + word2
# 7. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints the number of letters in the word.
# p "enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# p word.length
# 8. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a negative number" if the number is less than 0.
# p "enter a number"
# num = gets.chomp.to_i
# if num < 0
#   p "That's a negative number"
# end
# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the two numbers multiplied together.
# p "enter two nums"
# num1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# num2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# p num1 * num2
# 10. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints "That's a long word" if the word has more than 5 letters.
# p "Enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word.length > 5
#   p "That's a long word"
# end
